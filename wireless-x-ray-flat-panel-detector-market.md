<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wireless X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wireless X-Ray Flat Panel Detector market consists of two types: Direct Conversion and Indirect Conversion. In Direct Conversion detectors, incoming X-rays are converted directly into electrical signals by a photoconductor material. This results in better image quality due to the elimination of scintillator conversions. Indirect Conversion detectors, on the other hand, use a scintillator material to convert X-rays into visible light, which is further converted into electrical signals. While indirect conversion offers lower costs, direct conversion provides higher sensitivity and resolution. Both types serve specific purposes and are used in various applications within the medical imaging industry.</p></p>
