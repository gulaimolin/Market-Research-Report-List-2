<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food And Beverage Level Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contact-Less</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Food and Beverage Level Sensor Market consists of two main types: contact and contact-less sensors. Contact sensors are devices that require physical contact with the substance being measured to determine the level. They use technologies like floats or guided wave radar for accurate measurements. On the other hand, contact-less sensors can measure the level without any direct contact with the substance. They use technologies like ultrasonic or optical sensors, which emit signals and measure their reflection to determine the level. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in various food and beverage manufacturing processes.</p></p>
