<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Radiator Fan</li><li>Electric Radiator Fan</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle cooling fans market can be categorized into two main types: mechanical radiator fans and electric radiator fans. Mechanical radiator fans are powered by the engine's drive belt and are typically found in older vehicles. They work by drawing air through the radiator to cool the engine. On the other hand, electric radiator fans are powered by an electric motor and are commonly used in modern vehicles. They are controlled by sensors and provide more precise and efficient cooling. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining the optimal temperature of a vehicle's engine.</p></p>
