<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glycosidases Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endoglycosidase</li><li>Exoglycosidase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glycosidases refer to a group of enzymes that play a crucial role in breaking down complex carbohydrates. They are categorized into two types: Endoglycosidases and Exoglycosidases. Endoglycosidases act on the internal bonds within the carbohydrate chain, breaking it into smaller fragments. On the other hand, exoglycosidases act on the terminal bonds of the carbohydrate chain, removing one sugar residue at a time. Both types of glycosidases are important in various biological processes and have applications in industries such as food, pharmaceuticals, and research.</p></p>
