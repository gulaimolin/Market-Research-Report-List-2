<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Belt Drive Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Type</li><li>Axial Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Belt drive fans are categorized into two main types: centrifugal type and axial type. Centrifugal belt drive fans are designed to move air in a radial direction, where the air enters the fan at its center and is pushed outward towards the fan's outer circumference. These fans are commonly used in applications that require high-pressure air movement, such as HVAC systems. On the other hand, axial belt drive fans are designed to move air in a parallel or axial direction. Air enters the fan at one end and is forced out in the same direction parallel to the fan's axis. These fans are commonly used in applications where large volumes of air need to be moved at lower pressures, such as cooling electronic components or ventilation systems.</p></p>
