<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Suspension Valve Blocks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>For 2-Corner Air Suspension</li><li>For 4-Corner Air Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air suspension valve blocks are a crucial component of pneumatic systems in vehicles equipped with air suspension. These valve blocks are responsible for controlling the flow of compressed air within the suspension system. There are two main types of air suspension valve blocks based on the number of corners in the suspension setup: 2-corner and 4-corner air suspension valve blocks. The 2-corner valve blocks are designed for vehicles with air suspension on only two wheels, typically found in front or rear axle setups. On the other hand, 4-corner valve blocks are used in vehicles where air suspension is installed on all four wheels for improved stability and control.</p></p>
