<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Accommodative Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Optical Surface</li><li>Double Optical Surface</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Accommodative intraocular lenses (IOLs) are used in cataract surgeries to replace the natural lens and improve vision. Single optical surface IOLs have a single refractive surface that allows for lens movement and change in focus. They provide a limited range of accommodation. On the other hand, double optical surface IOLs have two refractive surfaces separated by a hinge, allowing for enhanced accommodation. These lenses provide a larger range of focus adjustment, improving vision at various distances. Both types aim to restore clear vision and reduce the need for glasses.</p></p>
