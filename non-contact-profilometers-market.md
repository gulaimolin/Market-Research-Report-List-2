<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Contact Profilometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>White Light Interference</li><li>Confocal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-contact profilometers are instruments used to measure the surface topography of objects without physically touching them. Two prominent types are white light interference and confocal profilers. White light interference profilers use light waves to create interference patterns that are captured to measure surface height variations. Confocal profilers use a focused laser beam and a pinhole aperture to create a small, illuminated spot on the surface, and measure the reflected light to obtain detailed height information. Both types offer high-resolution and precise surface measurements in various industries such as semiconductors, automotive, and aerospace.</p></p>
