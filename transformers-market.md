<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Transformer</li><li>Distribution Transformer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two main types of transformers in the market: power transformers and distribution transformers. Power transformers are used in high-voltage transmission systems to step down the voltage for distribution and ensure efficient power transfer. They are larger in size and operate at higher power levels. On the other hand, distribution transformers are employed in low voltage or secondary distribution systems to further reduce the voltage for end-users. These transformers are smaller and operate at lower power levels. Both types play a crucial role in the electricity distribution system, facilitating the smooth flow of power from generating stations to end-users.</p></p>
