<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Handheld Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Monitor market consists of two main types: PID (Photoionization Detector) and Metal-oxide Semiconductor. A PID monitor uses ultraviolet light to ionize VOC molecules, enabling their detection and measurement. It is highly sensitive and can detect a wide range of VOCs. On the other hand, a Metal-oxide Semiconductor monitor utilizes a heated sensor that reacts when exposed to VOCs, producing a change in electrical resistance. Both types of monitors are portable and widely used in industries such as environmental monitoring, industrial hygiene, and indoor air quality assessment.</p></p>
