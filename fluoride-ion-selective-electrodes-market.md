<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluoride Ion Selective Electrodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Membrane</li><li>PVC Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluoride ion selective electrodes are used to measure the concentration of fluoride ions in a solution. There are two main types of electrodes: liquid membrane and PVC membrane. Liquid membrane electrodes consist of a sensing membrane filled with a solution that is selective to fluoride ions. This solution interacts with the fluoride ions in the sample and generates an electric potential that can be measured. PVC membrane electrodes, on the other hand, use a polyvinyl chloride membrane that is selective to fluoride ions. This membrane allows only fluoride ions to pass through, generating an electric potential for measurement.</p></p>
