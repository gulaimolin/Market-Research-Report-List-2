<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Windmills Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Windmills</li><li>Vertical Windmills</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Windmills can be classified into two main types: horizontal windmills and vertical windmills. Horizontal windmills have their blades aligned parallel to the ground and are commonly seen in large wind farms. These windmills are more efficient in converting wind energy into electricity but require vast open spaces for installation. On the other hand, vertical windmills have their blades arranged in a vertical orientation. They are more suitable for urban areas due to their smaller size and ability to harness wind from any direction. However, vertical windmills may have lower energy conversion efficiency.</p></p>
