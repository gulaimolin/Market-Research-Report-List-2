<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Active Noise Cancellation Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Feedforward Active Noise Reduction</li><li>Back Fed Active Noise Reduction</li><li>Hybrid Active Noise Reduction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active noise cancellation technology is designed to minimize unwanted background noise by generating sound waves that cancel out external sounds. There are three types of active noise cancellation technologies:</p><p>1. Feedforward Active Noise Reduction: This method uses microphones placed outside the earphones or speakers to detect incoming noise. The system then produces an anti-phase sound wave to cancel out the original noise, providing effective noise reduction.</p><p>2. Back Fed Active Noise Reduction: In this approach, the microphones are placed inside the earphones or speakers to capture the sound experienced by the user. The system then generates anti-phase sound waves to counteract the noise and deliver a more immersive listening experience.</p><p>3. Hybrid Active Noise Reduction: This technology combines both feedforward and back fed active noise reduction techniques. It uses both internal and external microphones to capture and cancel out noise, providing enhanced noise cancellation and improved audio quality.</p></p>
