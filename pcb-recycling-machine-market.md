<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB Recycling Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-voltage Electrostatic Separation Type</li><li>Non-high voltage Electrostatic Separation Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PCB recycling machine market can be divided into two types: high-voltage electrostatic separation type and non-high voltage electrostatic separation type. The high-voltage electrostatic separation type uses high voltage electricity to separate the metal and non-metal components of printed circuit boards (PCBs), resulting in efficient recycling. On the other hand, the non-high voltage electrostatic separation type uses alternative methods, such as physical crushing and air separation, to achieve PCB recycling. Both types aim to recover valuable materials from PCBs while minimizing environmental impact.</p></p>
