<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HD Surgical Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cmos</li><li>CCD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HD surgical camera market consists of two main types: CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) and CCD (Charge-Coupled Device). CMOS cameras use a sensor that converts light into an electrical charge and captures high-definition images with low power consumption. CCD cameras, on the other hand, use a different technology where each pixel is converted into an electrical charge and transferred slowly to produce high-quality images. Both types offer advanced imaging capabilities for surgical procedures, but the choice between them depends on factors like cost, power consumption, and image quality requirements.</p></p>
