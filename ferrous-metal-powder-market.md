<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ferrous Metal Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Compaction</li><li>Hot Compaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ferrous metal powder market is classified into two types: cold compaction and hot compaction. In cold compaction, the process involves pressing the metal powder under high pressure at room temperature to create a compacted shape. This method is cost-effective and suitable for producing components with simple shapes. On the other hand, hot compaction involves heating the metal powder and then pressing it into a desired shape. This method allows for more complex shapes and better mechanical properties, but it is more expensive compared to cold compaction.</p></p>
