<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reflective Traffic Signage Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microprismatic</li><li>Glass Beads</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Reflective traffic signage films are essential for enhancing visibility and safety on the roads. There are two major types of market technologies used in these films: microprismatic and glass beads. Microprismatic films consist of tiny prisms that reflect light back to its source, making them highly visible from different angles. On the other hand, glass beads films use tiny glass beads embedded on the surface to reflect light back, increasing visibility at night or in low-light conditions. Both types contribute to better road safety by improving the visibility and legibility of traffic signs.</p></p>
