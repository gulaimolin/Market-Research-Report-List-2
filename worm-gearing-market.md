<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Worm Gearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Envelope Worm Gear</li><li>Double Envelope Worm Gear</li><li>Non-enveloping Worm Gear</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Worm gearing market types include single envelope worm gear, double envelope worm gear, and non-enveloping worm gear. Single envelope worm gear has the worm that envelops the wheel, resulting in higher torque capacity but lower running efficiency. In double envelope worm gear, both the worm and wheel envelop each other, improving the efficiency but reducing the torque capacity. Non-enveloping worm gear lacks the enveloping characteristic, increasing efficiency, but limiting torque capacity. These variations offer different trade-offs between torque capacity and efficiency, catering to different applications and customer preferences in the market.</p></p>
