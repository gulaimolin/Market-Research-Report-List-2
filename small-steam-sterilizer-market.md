<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Steam Sterilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity</li><li>SFPP</li><li>Pre-Vac</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the small steam sterilizer market, there are three main types: gravity sterilizers, SFPP sterilizers, and pre-vac sterilizers. Gravity sterilizers use gravity displacement to remove air from the sterilization chamber and allow steam to enter. SFPP sterilizers use a prevacuum pump to create a partial vacuum, removing air from the chamber more effectively. Pre-vac sterilizers have a vacuum pump that draws air and steam from the chamber before the sterilization process begins. These different types offer varying levels of air removal and sterilization efficiency in small steam sterilization applications.</p></p>
