<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Anti-scaling Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer-based</li><li>Phosphonate-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial anti-scaling chemicals market includes two main types: polymer-based and phosphonate-based chemicals. Polymer-based chemicals are substances that contain polymers, which are large molecules made up of repeating subunits. These chemicals are effective in preventing scaling in various industrial processes, such as water treatment and oil refining, by inhibiting mineral deposits. Phosphonate-based chemicals, on the other hand, are compounds derived from phosphonic acid. They work by forming stable complexes with metal ions, preventing them from precipitating and causing scale formation. Both types of chemicals play a crucial role in maintaining efficient and smooth industrial operations.</p></p>
