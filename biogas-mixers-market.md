<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Mixers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible Mixers</li><li>Dry-installed Mixers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biogas mixers are used in the biogas industry to ensure efficient mixing and homogenization of substrates in anaerobic digesters. Submersible mixers are installed directly into the biogas reactors, allowing for uniform mixing of the substrate with minimal energy consumption. On the other hand, dry-installed mixers are mounted outside the tank and use a propeller to circulate the substrate. These mixers are ideal for large-scale biogas plants where submersible installation is not feasible. Both types of mixers play a crucial role in enhancing biogas production and maintaining a stable fermentation process.</p></p>
