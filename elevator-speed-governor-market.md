<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elevator Speed Governor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Type</li><li>Resonance Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Elevator Speed Governor Market is categorized into two types. The Centrifugal Type operates by the centrifugal force generated when the elevator platform moves, activating the governor to control the speed. On the other hand, the Resonance Type uses resonance between wire ropes and a weight to control the elevator's speed. Both types are crucial for elevator safety as they regulate the speed and prevent the elevator from exceeding safe limits. These variations in speed governor types provide options for elevator manufacturers and operators based on their specific requirements.</p></p>
