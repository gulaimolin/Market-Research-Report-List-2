<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel Retail Terminal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible Systems</li><li>Suction Systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fuel retail terminals can be categorized into two types: submersible systems and suction systems. Submersible systems involve the use of submerged pumps that are installed directly inside storage tanks, enabling them to efficiently pump fuel. This type of system is commonly used in high-volume fueling stations. Suction systems, on the other hand, utilize above-ground pumps that draw fuel from underground tanks, making them suitable for smaller-scale fuel retail operations. These systems are designed to ensure the safe and efficient dispensing of fuel to customers.</p></p>
