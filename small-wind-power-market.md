<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Wind Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small wind power market consists of two main types of wind turbines: Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs). HAWTs have blades spinning around a horizontal axis, similar to the large-scale turbines used in wind farms. They are efficient and reliable in high wind conditions. VAWTs, on the other hand, have blades spinning around a vertical axis and can capture wind from any direction. They are suitable for urban or low-wind environments and have appealing aesthetics. Both types contribute to the growing small wind power market.</p></p>
